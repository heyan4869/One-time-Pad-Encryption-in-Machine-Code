## One-time Pad Encryption in Machine Code

Often we have a message that we want to keep secret from some third party. For example, we want to email someone our social security number, but donâ€™t want anyone who intercepts our email to be able to read it. There are many such encryption schemes, and designing good encryption schemes and secure transmission protocols is a very active area of research. One-time pad is one such encryption scheme that is ancient.

Suppose we have a message t, encoded as stream of bits:

`t = 010101000000011111100010101`

If we have a secret key s of the same length:

`s = 111101010001111100101010101`

We could encrypt t by computing r = t XOR s, where XOR is the function so that sets the ith bit of r based on the ith bits of t and s.
